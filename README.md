# Next Starter

An opinionated Next.js starter template, aiming to provide a starting point for scalable, professional-grade front-end projects.

- TypeScript
- SCSS modules
- Storybook
- Linting: ESLint, stylelint, commitlint
- Testing: Jest for component-based unit testing and Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Husky git hooks with lint-staged for automated linting, formatting, and testing
- Github Actions (CI, CodeQL analysis, tests)
- Dockerfile

## Usage

Install dependencies with `yarn`, then `yarn dev` to start the dev server. Run `yarn build` to build (and type-check) a production build; serve it with `yarn start`.

For further commands to interact with the additional tooling, refer to the scripts in `package.json`.
